# pclass: A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)
# 1st = Upper

# age: Age is fractional if less than 1. If the age is estimated, is it in the form of xx.5

# sibsp: The dataset defines family relations in this way...
# Sibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister
# Spouse = husband, wife (mistresses and fianc√©s were ignored)

# parch: The dataset defines family relations in this way...
# Parent = mother, father
# Child = daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson
# Some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them
